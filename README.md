# OpenDraft PT Recovery

Product-first PT Sessions experience built with Next.js.

## What this app includes

- Session timeline with status progression
- Rich in-session view: objective, metrics, findings, assignments
- Open questions + follow-up tracking
- Event timeline and context/safety notes
- Built-in adaptability modes in the same interface (no separate product branches)
- Lightweight `/launch` teaser page for listing/marketing links

## SSOT and safety positioning

This UI demonstrates workflow and context handling only. It is powered by user-provided context and custom metrics, and it is not medical advice.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```
